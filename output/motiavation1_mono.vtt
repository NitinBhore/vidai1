00:00 --> 00:01
I believe in the power of

00:01 --> 00:02
 words. Many people speak

00:02 --> 00:03
 before they think, but I know

00:03 --> 00:08
 the value of words.

00:08 --> 00:09
The words can make you, break

00:09 --> 00:10
 you, they can heal your soul,

00:10 --> 00:13
 they can damage you forever.

00:13 --> 00:14
So I always try to use the

00:14 --> 00:15
 positive words in my life

00:15 --> 00:18
 wherever I go.

00:18 --> 00:19
They call it adversity, I call

00:19 --> 00:20
 it opportunity. They call it

00:20 --> 00:23
 weakness, I call it strength.

00:23 --> 00:24
They call me disabled, I call

00:24 --> 00:25
 myself differently abled.

00:25 --> 00:29
 They see my disability.

00:29 --> 00:30


00:30 --> 00:31


00:31 --> 00:32


00:32 --> 00:33


00:33 --> 00:34
They see my disability, I see

00:34 --> 00:35
 my ability. There are some

00:35 --> 00:36
 incidents that happen in your

00:36 --> 00:41
 life,

00:41 --> 00:42
and those incidents are so

00:42 --> 00:43
 strong that they change your

00:43 --> 00:47
 DNA.

00:47 --> 00:48


00:48 --> 00:49
Those incidents or accidents

00:49 --> 00:50
 are so strong that they break

00:50 --> 00:53
 you physically.

00:53 --> 00:54
They deform your body but they

00:54 --> 00:57
 transform your soul.
