    "transcript": "I believe in the power of  words. Many people speak  before they think, but I know  the value of words. The words can make you, break  you, they can heal your soul,  they can damage you forever. So I always try to use the  positive words in my life  wherever I go. They call it adversity, I call  it opportunity. They call it  weakness, I call it strength. They call me disabled, I call  myself differently abled.  They see my disability.     They see my disability, I see  my ability. There are some  incidents that happen in your  life, and those incidents are so  strong that they change your  DNA.  Those incidents or accidents  are so strong that they break  you physically. They deform your body but they  transform your soul.",
